MNIST contains 60,000 training examples and 10,000 validation examples. Each example consists of 28-x28 black-and-white image and the digit the image represents. The task at hand is thus a multi-label **classification** problem where the model needs to predict the digit given an input image.\n","\n","Classification has equally important applications (cancer detection for example) as regression. In addition, it is used in generative adversarial networks, a type of neural network that is remarkably good at generating complex data, so it'll serve as an important foundation for later weeks.\n","\n","MNIST is such a well-known example that the dataset is usually easily downloadable in the right format. In the case of PyTorch, we can use the `torchvision` package, which contains useful datasets, model architectures, and utility functions for computer vision.\n","\n",">**Note:**\n",">The mamba environments for the mac and windows versions of this homework are different.

Data can come from a variety of places. If it is something that you have gone out and collected (e.g. experimental observations, real photos of the world, etc.) then it is what is often called *wild data*. However, it is not always the case that you can get wild data for your problem, in fact for many applications where you are training your own models for design applications it is likely that wild data is either very poor quality or simply does not exist. In this case it is also possible to train a model using *synthetic data*. This is data which you have generated somehow. This might be from a parametric model that you have created, from a simulation tool (think FEA or CFD), or from some other workflow that you have developed to create a diverse set of samples to train your model on. \n","\n","In our case we will be generating our own synthetic data set to train on. This data set will be points along a sine curve that have been perturbed by some random noise. You should generate points (try 20,000) that range in the x direction from  $-3\\pi$ to $3\\pi$ and the y values should be the sine of the x values.

Now you have a bunch of data points to work with, however they are still very organized. We want to simulate some randomness in our data set to make it a little bit more interesting. To do this you can add a small random perturbation to each of the x and y points that you just generated. When generating synthetic data it is often a very good idea to introduce this kind of adjustment into your dataset as it will make your model more robust against small changes when you try evaluating it in the future. We will see in the future that is also useful to add random perturbations even when you have wild data in order to increase the size of your dataset. This is often referred to as *data augmentation* and you will see this term frequently when dealing with training data. \n","\n","For this specific problem you can think about this randomness like a measurement error. Perhaps you have a very fast way to take a lot of measurements, but those measurements aren't very accurate, they might be off by +/- 30% but you can make thousands of them in a second. To do this you should generate a list of small random values to add the the x and y positions of your points.

Here I have defined a custom dataset that inherits from the Pytorch Dataset. This dataset creator converts input data into [tensors](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/introyt/tensors_deeper_tutorial.html). If you are not familiar with the concept of a tensor then I suggest you take a look at the link. Tensors are multidimensional arrays that are used by pytorch and understanding how to manipulate them is essential when training machine learning models. One confusing thing about working with tensors is that you often need to convert back and forth between numpy arrays and tensors. You will usually get an error when you have not done this correctly. Dimension mismatch and conversion errors will happen all the time, you will learn to debug them as you work more with these models.

There are definitely other techniques you could use to do this particular task, however, the MLP is a more general tool than some of the more classical techniques you might use for this curve fitting task. With very few changes we were able to train a simple MLP to recognize digits from raw images (flattened as vectors). The reality is that this is also not the best type of neural network for this task, and a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) would easily outperform this model. In addition, this model would not deal very well with translations and rotations because it does not actually recognize shape features, it only deals with pixels on an individual basis.\n","\n","To demonstrate this, we could simply consistently reorder pixels (making the digits undiscernible to a human) and train a MLP that would acheive the same performance.\n","\n","We'll return to the MNIST dataset multiple times in later weeks, and we will actually train a CNN on this exact task.\n","\n","Congratulations on finishing HW1. Please make sure you run all your cells and then commit and push your notebook to github. Also please zip the entire HW1 folder that this notebook is in and submit the zip folder on canvas.
